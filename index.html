            <h2>Where young mavericks build the future</h2>
            <blockquote>Mavericks: <i>Not afraid to take risks, question the status quo, and pursue groundbreaking ideas that could lead to major innovations and transformations.</i></blockquote>
            <p>If you’ve ever felt out of place in a world that values conformity over curiosity, welcome. You’ve found your place.</p>
            <p>Most people are content to follow the rules and climb the ladder. FR8 is for those who won’t accept the world as it is. It’s for the restless, the builders, the scientists and the problem-solvers who see what could be instead of settling for what already exists.</p>
            <p>FR8 is for those who are frustrated. Frustrated with a system that discourages risk-taking. A system that doesn’t celebrate people willing to bet everything on their ideas. A system that tells you what to build and what to research.</p>
            <p>We’re frustrated too. That’s why we created FR8 — a place where you can immerse yourself into your craziest ideas and focus on your true interests.</p>

            <p>People ready to go all in on their craziest ideas.</p>
            <p>If you’ve built things from scratch, obsess over specific technologies, fall down Wikipedia rabbit holes, feel like you don’t quite fit the system, or want to push your limits and go all in, you might be exactly who we’re looking for. If you wake up every day with a burning need to create, solve, and learn, we want to know more about you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mostly people under 30.</strong></li>
                <li>Technical talent working on software, hardware, or deep-tech. If you have a non-technical background, you must apply as part of a team with a technical member.</li>
                <li>People driven by a hunger for progress, not for money or status, but for growth, innovation, and creation.</li>
                <li>We welcome solo founders, but we prefer teams.</li>
