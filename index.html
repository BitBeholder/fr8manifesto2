            <h2>Where young mavericks build the future</h2>
            <blockquote>Mavericks: <i>Not afraid to take risks, question the status quo, and pursue groundbreaking ideas that could lead to major innovations and transformations.</i></blockquote>
            <p>If you’ve ever felt out of place in a world that values conformity over curiosity, welcome. You’ve found your place.</p>
            <p>Most people are content to follow the rules and climb the ladder. FR8 is for those who won’t accept the world as it is. It’s for the restless, the builders, the scientists and the problem-solvers who see what could be instead of settling for what already exists.</p>
            <p>FR8 is for those who are frustrated. Frustrated with a system that discourages risk-taking. A system that doesn’t celebrate people willing to bet everything on their ideas. A system that tells you what to build and what to research.</p>
            <p>We’re frustrated too. That’s why we’re creating FR8 — a place where you can immerse yourself into your craziest ideas and focus on your true interests.</p>

            <h2>Concretely:</h2>
            <p>We are running the world's first hacker hotel in Espoo, Finland. It's combination of a startup incubator and research lab.</p><br>

                <li>A <strong>program</strong> tailored to help you set clear goals, stay accountable, and maintain focus.</li>
                <li>Access to our <strong>network of founders, investors, professors, companies, and industry experts</strong>. We’ll connect you with the right people who can actually help you.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools</strong>: Credits, 3D printers, soldering equipment, electronic components, access to CNC machines, and more.</li>

            <h2>Who are we looking for?</h2>
            <p>If you’ve won coding competitions, crushed math Olympiads, built things from scratch, are extremely passionate about specific technologies, or you have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes of curiosity on Wikipedia, you could be a perfect fit for FR8. If you wake up every day with a burning need to create, solve, and learn, we want to know more about you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ages 16–28.</strong></li>
                <li>Technical talent working on software, hardware, or deep-tech. If you have a non-technical background, you must apply as part of a team with a technical member.</li>
                <li>People driven by a hunger for progress, not for money or status, but for growth, innovation, and creation.</li>
                <li>We welcome solo founders, but it’s even better if you already have a team or a co-founder in mind.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl1T6cXcUI4">People who want to challenge themselves.</a></li>

            <h2>What do we believe in?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-principles thinking</strong>: Question everything, break it down, and build from the ground up.</li>
                <li><strong>Rules are made up by people.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Techno-optimism</strong>: Technology can solve humanity’s toughest problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Results over ideas.</strong> Execution is everything.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Building what people love.</strong></li>

            <h2>What’s the catch?</h2>
            <p>FR8 is a <strong>non-profit.</strong> We take no equity, and the program costs nothing. Absolutely no strings attached.</p>
            <p>Hard to believe? We know, but it’s true.</p>
            <p>We’re funded by sponsorships, and every dime goes into supporting you. Your success is our success. That’s how we keep FR8 running and growing.</p>
