            <h2>Where young mavericks build the future</h2>
            <blockquote>Mavericks: <i>Not afraid to take risks, question the status quo, and pursue groundbreaking ideas that could lead to major innovations and transformations.</i></blockquote>
            <p>If you’ve ever felt out of place in a world that values conformity over curiosity, welcome. You’ve found your place.</p>
            <p>Most people are content to follow the rules and climb the ladder. FR8 is for those who won’t accept the world as it is. It’s for the restless, the builders, the scientists and the problem-solvers who see what could be instead of settling for what already exists.</p>
            <p>FR8 is for those who are frustrated. Frustrated with a system that discourages risk-taking. A system that doesn’t celebrate people willing to bet everything on their ideas. A system that tells you what to build and what to research.</p>
            <p>We’re frustrated too. That’s why we created FR8 — a place where you can immerse yourself into your craziest ideas and focus on your true interests.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Concretely:</h2>
            <p>We, a small group of students and dropouts, are running the world’s first-ever hacker hotel, startup incubator, and research lab — all combined into one. We bring together the smartest young technical mavericks from all around the globe and give them a chance to go all-in on their craziest ideas.</p><br>
            <img src="public\fr8manifestopic11.jpg" alt="FR8 hotel" />
            <br>
            <h2>Here’s what we offer:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accommodation and food</strong>, your own hotel room and startup-style 5-star service fully covered for the whole duration of the program. No financial barriers.</li>
                <li>We cover your flights if you’re traveling from abroad.</li>
                <li>A <strong>community</strong> built around high standards, curiosity, and interest in solving complex problems.</li>
                <li>A <strong>program</strong> tailored to help you set clear goals, stay accountable, and maintain focus.</li>
                <li>Access to our <strong>network of founders, investors, professors, companies, and industry experts</strong>. We’ll connect you with the right people who can actually help you.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools</strong>: Credits, 3D printers, soldering equipment, electronic components, access to CNC machines, and more.</li>
                <li>We use around <strong>$20,000</strong> per participant. This means covering everything from living expenses to flights and so on. Note: Not funding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We’re here to do everything we can to help you turn your ideas into reality and build something from 0 to 1.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Who are we looking for?</h2>
            <p>If you’ve won coding competitions, crushed math Olympiads, built things from scratch, are extremely passionate about specific technologies, or you have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes of curiosity on Wikipedia, you could be a perfect fit for FR8. If you wake up every day with a burning need to create, solve, and learn, we want to know more about you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ages 16–28.</strong></li>
                <li>Technical talent working on software, hardware, or deep-tech. If you have a non-technical background, you must apply as part of a team with a technical member.</li>
                <li>People driven by a hunger for progress, not for money or status, but for growth, innovation, and creation.</li>
                <li>We welcome solo founders, but it’s even better if you already have a team or a co-founder in mind.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl1T6cXcUI4">People who want to challenge themselves.</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What do we believe in?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-principles thinking</strong>: Question everything, break it down, and build from the ground up.</li>
                <li><strong>Rules are made up by people.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Techno-optimism</strong>: Technology can solve humanity’s toughest problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Results over ideas.</strong> Execution is everything.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Building what people love.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Deep work > shallow work.</strong></li>
                <br>

            <h2>Our values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kindness:</strong> We have a strict no-assholes policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> If you’re here to cash out with a quick B2B SaaS exit, look elsewhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard work and focus.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Craziness:</strong> The kind that sparks bold ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Maverick spirit:</strong> Follow your own path and intuition.</li>
                <li><strong>Builders, nerds, and visionaries:</strong> You are our people.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>What’s the catch?</h2>
            <p>FR8 is a <strong>non-profit.</strong> We take no equity, and the program costs nothing. Absolutely no strings attached.</p>
            <p>Hard to believe? We know, but it’s true.</p>
            <p>We’re funded by sponsorships, and every dime goes into supporting you. Your success is our success. That’s how we keep FR8 running and growing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Our vision for the future</h2>
            <p>We want to see a world where the brightest minds can focus on what excites them. We believe that’s where real breakthroughs begin. FR8 will be the place where the next wave of groundbreaking technologies and generational technology companies will be born.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Important notes</h2>
            <p><strong>FR8 is hardcore</strong>. We have high standards. If you’re not meeting them, you’re out.</p>
            <p>We’re not a startup accelerator/incubator, or a VC. We’re something completely new.</p>
            <p>We're fully student-run.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>We are located in Otaniemi, Espoo, on Aalto University's campus in Finland.</p>
            <p>That means dark, freezing winters, ice-cold sea plunges, and people who treat small talk like a mortal sin. Perfect conditions for an all-in focus retreat.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why apply to FR8?</h2>
            <p>It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see what you can achieve when you go all in.</p>
            <p>How much more time will you let slip away before taking action on your real purpose?</p>
