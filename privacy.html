            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 6, 2025</p>
            <p>This privacy policy explains how FR8 collects, uses, and protects your data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
    
            <h3>What we collect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Answers to application questions</li>
                <li>Resume or CV</li>
                <li>Links you provide (e.g., GitHub, personal website, LinkedIn)</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Why we collect it</h3>
            <p>To review your application, improve our program, and possibly (with your consent) connect you with trusted partners and supporters.</p>
    
            <h3>Sharing your data</h3>
            <p>We never share your data without your explicit consent. If you check “yes” on the application form, we may share relevant information with selected companies or supporters relevant to your work. For example, this could include sharing relevant job or collaboration opportunities. You can withdraw consent at any time by emailing us.</p>
    
            <h3>How we store your data</h3>
            <p>We use secure tools (e.g. Tally, Google Workspace) to manage applications. We retain applicant data only as long as necessary to evaluate applications, improve the program, understand long-term impact or potentially reach out about future opportunities, unless you request its deletion.</p>
    
            <h3>Your rights under GDPR</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Access, correct, or delete your data</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
                <li>Contact us: nantte@fr8.so</li>
                <li>Contact your local data protection authority if you believe your rights have been violated</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Cookies & analytics</h3>
            <p>We may use basic analytics (e.g., Google Analytics). We do not track personal data across websites or services.</p>
    
            <h3>Updates to this policy</h3>
            <p>We may occasionally update this policy. The latest version is always available here.</p>
